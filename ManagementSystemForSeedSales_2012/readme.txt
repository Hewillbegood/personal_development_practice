This program was written not only for personal practice, but also for actual use. As the name suggest, it is a program for managing sales of crop seeds.
Generally, the program was done using C# and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) library on .NET Framework, and a Microsoft Access file was its database.
Specific features:
(1) Receipt Issuing: the program can generate receipts in certain format and send it to a printer.
(2) Database Modification: a user can change the info (e.g., commodity and address info) stored in the database file using the UI offered in the program. 
(3) Accounting: sales record will be kept and ready for query and printing with all kinds of filters. To use this feature, press Lshift + Rctrl + Q and Lshift + Rctrl + T.
(4) Pleasant UI and animation achieved using WPF.
(5) Various checks for user input correctness to gurantee the robustness and reliability of the program in actual use.

Last compilation was by Visual Studio Community 2015.
