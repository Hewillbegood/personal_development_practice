This folder contains code I wrote to solve some Google Code Jam problems in early 2015.
Files are named after the problem titles.
You can visit this page (https://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html) and scroll to the bottom. The problems I tried to solve are mainly located in the last several problem sets.
About some of them, although I tried really hard and even implemented multiple editions of code, I still could not pass the test.
